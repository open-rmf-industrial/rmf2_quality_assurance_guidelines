Industrial CI
=============

The Industrial CI (Continuous Integration) contains the various
CI configuration for ROS (Robot Operating System) and scripts that any
ROS-powered packages or projects could utilize. Some features include:

- Checking if your package builds, installs without issues. If unit/system
  tests are defined run them. (ROS Prerelease Test can optionally be run.)
- Proven to cover the general requirements of the ROS-based robotics
  repositories. Easily configurable.
- Users can add custom pre/post processes.

.. note::

   More information on the Industrial CI could be found `here <https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci/>`__.

In the subsequent sections, we would be looking at some ways in which the
Industrial CI could be integrated into your projects.
