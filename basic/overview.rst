Overview
========

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is the practice of automating the integration
of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project.
By integrating regularly, you can detect and locate errors quickly.

Some practices for CI are:

* Maintain a single-source repository
* Automate the build
* Make your build self-testing
* Build every commit on an integration machine
* Keep the build fast
* Test in a clone of the production environment
* Make it easy for users to get the latest executable version
* Visualize for users
* Automate deployment

Some basic knowledge you need before setting up a CI pipeline

* Basic knowledge about **Docker** and **Dockerfile**
* Instantiation of a (Linux) server (either physical or virtual) running Docker
* Creation of a ``.yml`` file
* Basic knowledge about **bash** script
* Basic knowledge on how your CI platform works (like **Travis Ci**,
  **Gitlab Ci** and etc.. )
* Basic knowledge about Statics Analysis
* Basic knowledge about Dynamic Analysis
* Basic knowledge about Code Coverage
